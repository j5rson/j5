just a bare bones repository to introduce people to me

My name is Jeff Iverson. Way back in 1987 I made a small splash in the Macintosh HyperCard community.

Since 1996 I've mostly worked in the world of Java in the enterprise.

I recently got a used Mac mini (Catalina) and wanted to explore Mac development again.
